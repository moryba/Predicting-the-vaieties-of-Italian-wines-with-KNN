# Predicting-the-vaieties-of-wines-with-KNN

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to understand KNN by creating a model that is able to predict the varieties of wines.

## Usage
```python
import sklearn
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
```
